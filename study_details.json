The main goal is to obtain feasibility information on the protocol which has been used in other similar conditions. We will also evaluate multiple measurement tools in order to optimize a follow-up pilot study evaluating the impact of the protocol on migraines."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Migraines","Chronic Pain"],"keywords":["Migraines","Headaches","Chronic Pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"This is a cohort study in which all participants will receive the mind-body intervention. This is an exploratory study to help hone elements of the protocol through participant feedback and to determine variance and optimal survey measurement tools.

In addition, individualized sessions will be offered each week for students who have additional questions and/or need additional time with the material.","armGroupLabels":["Mind-Body Intervention"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"MIDAS","description":"The 7-item Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) is a commonly used and well validated self report survey for assessing migraine-related disability. Questions cover adverse life impacts (missed work, etc.), headache frequency, and headache intensity.","timeFrame":"baseline, 4, 8, 13 and 20 weeks"},{"measure":"HIT-6","description":"The Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), a well-validated self reported survey, measures the impact of headaches on 6 aspects of health-related quality of life. A recent study has estimated that a change of 6-7 points was clinically meaningful in a cohort starting with a mean HIT-6 score of 65.0 (severe impact). The HIT-6 is a recommended NIH common data element for headache.","timeFrame":"baseline, 4, 8, 13 and 20 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Brief Pain Inventory Questionnaire (Short Form)","description":"The Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire, which has been validated by Keller et al., will be utilized to gauge pain intensity during the duration of the study. The question about current pain medications will be modified slightly to include current frequency of use.","timeFrame":"baseline, 4, 8, 13 and 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale (Short Form 20)","description":"The short form Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale (PASS-20) is a 20 question survey assessing cognitive, avoidance, fear, and physiological anxiety due to pain. It has been validated by McCracken et al.","timeFrame":"baseline, 4, 8, 13 and 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Somatic Symptoms Score (SSS-8)","description":"The 8 question Somatic Symptoms Score (SSS-8) is a validated, abbreviated version of the 15 question Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-15. SSS-8 survey questions pertain to pain, the gastrointestinal system, fatigue, and cardiovascular complaints.","timeFrame":"baseline, 4, 8, 13 and 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Migraine Duration","description":"We will ask participants to estimate how long, on the average, their migraine attacks lasted during the last two weeks.","timeFrame":"baseline, 4, 8, 13 and 20 weeks"},{"measure":"NRS-11","description":"The 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) for headache pain intensity asks the patient to rate their pain intensity from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). The NRS-11 is recommended by the International Headache Society (IHS) for assessment of this parameter in clinical trials.","timeFrame":"baseline, 4, 8, 13 and 20 weeks"},{"measure":"GAMS","description":"The single question Global Assessment of Migraine Severity (GAMS) captures a patient's assessment of their overall disease severity. The GAMS is being tested at this stage because there is an abundance of published baseline and variance data for comparison.","timeFrame":"baseline, 4, 8, 13 and 20 weeks"},{"measure":"Feedback on protocol","description":"We will be receiving qualitative feedback on the protocol","timeFrame":"13 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
